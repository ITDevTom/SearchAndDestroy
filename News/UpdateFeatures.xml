Search and Destroy has been updated to support Rimworld version 1.1 (including the expansion). Credits go to Odyssey Scorpio, who helped out with updating. Thanks to this amazing community my mods are being kept alive! This version also supports Rimworld 1.0, so no need to worry if you're still using that version.
